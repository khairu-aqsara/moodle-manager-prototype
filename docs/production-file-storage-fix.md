# Production File Storage Fix - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document details a critical fix implemented for the Moodle Prototype Manager application to resolve file storage issues in production builds. The fix addresses the problem where the application was unable to create and write necessary configuration files (`container.id` and `moodle.txt`) when running as a packaged application on macOS and Windows.

## Problem Description

### Issue Summary

In production builds, the application was attempting to write configuration files to the application bundle directory (e.g., `Contents/MacOS/` on macOS), which is not writeable due to operating system security restrictions. This caused the application to fail when trying to:

1. Save container ID information (`container.id` file)
2. Store Moodle credentials (`moodle.txt` file)
3. Create necessary configuration files for persistent state

### Affected Platforms

- **macOS**: Applications packaged as `.app` bundles cannot write to `Contents/MacOS/` directory
- **Windows**: Applications installed in `Program Files` cannot write to the installation directory without elevated permissions
- **Linux**: Similar restrictions apply when applications are installed in system directories

### Error Symptoms

Users reported the following symptoms:
- Application would start successfully
- Health checks would pass (Docker and Internet connectivity)
- Container operations would appear to work but fail silently
- No credential information would be displayed
- Subsequent launches would not remember previous container state

### Technical Root Cause

The issue was in the `storage/files.go` file, specifically in the `getBaseDir()` method:

```go
// Original problematic implementation
func (fm *FileManager) getBaseDir() string {
    // This would return the executable directory even in production
    if executable, err := os.Executable(); err == nil {
        return filepath.Dir(executable)
    }
    return "."
}
```

In production builds:
- `os.Executable()` returns the path to the binary inside the app bundle
- On macOS: `/Applications/Moodle Prototype Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Moodle Prototype Manager`
- The parent directory is not writable by the application
- File creation operations would fail with permission denied errors

## Solution Implementation

### Architecture Changes

The fix implements a sophisticated directory detection strategy that differentiates between development and production environments:

```go
// Enhanced implementation with environment detection
func (fm *FileManager) getBaseDir() string {
    var baseDir string

    // First, check current working directory for go.mod (development detection)
    if wd, err := os.Getwd(); err == nil {
        if _, err := os.Stat(filepath.Join(wd, "go.mod")); err == nil {
            // Development environment - use working directory
            baseDir = wd
            fmt.Printf("[DEBUG] Development mode detected, using: %s\n", baseDir)
            return baseDir
        }
    }

    // Try to get executable directory and check for go.mod there too
    if executable, err := os.Executable(); err == nil {
        execDir := filepath.Dir(executable)
        if _, err := os.Stat(filepath.Join(execDir, "go.mod")); err == nil {
            // Development environment - go.mod is in exec dir
            baseDir = execDir
            fmt.Printf("[DEBUG] Development mode (exec dir), using: %s\n", baseDir)
            return baseDir
        }
    }

    // Production environment - use user data directory
    baseDir = fm.getUserDataDir()
    fmt.Printf("[DEBUG] Production mode, using user data dir: %s\n", baseDir)

    // Ensure directory exists
    if err := os.MkdirAll(baseDir, 0755); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("[ERROR] Failed to create user data directory %s: %v\n", baseDir, err)
        // Fallback to working directory
        if wd, err := os.Getwd(); err == nil {
            baseDir = wd
        } else {
            baseDir = "."
        }
    }

    return baseDir
}
```

### User Data Directory Strategy

The fix implements platform-specific user data directories following operating system conventions:

```go
func (fm *FileManager) getUserDataDir() string {
    appName := ".moodle-prototype-manager"

    // Use consistent directory across all platforms
    if home, err := os.UserHomeDir(); err == nil {
        return filepath.Join(home, appName)
    }

    // Fallback strategy
    if wd, err := os.Getwd(); err == nil {
        return wd
    }
    return "."
}
```

**Directory Locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/.moodle-prototype-manager/`
- **Windows**: `~/.moodle-prototype-manager/` (resolves to user profile directory)
- **Linux**: `~/.moodle-prototype-manager/`

### Environment Detection Logic

The solution uses a multi-layered approach to detect the runtime environment:

1. **Primary Detection**: Check for `go.mod` file in current working directory
2. **Secondary Detection**: Check for `go.mod` file in executable directory
3. **Production Mode**: If neither check finds `go.mod`, assume production deployment
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple fallback options if primary strategy fails

### Enhanced Error Handling

The fix includes comprehensive error handling and debugging:

```go
// Directory creation with error handling
if err := os.MkdirAll(baseDir, 0755); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("[ERROR] Failed to create user data directory %s: %v\n", baseDir, err)

    // Implement fallback strategy
    if wd, err := os.Getwd(); err == nil {
        baseDir = wd
        fmt.Printf("[DEBUG] Falling back to working dir: %s\n", baseDir)
    } else {
        baseDir = "."
        fmt.Printf("[DEBUG] All methods failed, using current dir\n")
    }
}
```
